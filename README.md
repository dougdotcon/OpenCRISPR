# OpenCrisprSystem

![OpenCrisprSystem Header](imgs/header.png)

**OpenCrisprSystem** is a collection of free, open, and AI-designed gene editing systems developed by Profluent Bio. It serves as a comprehensive resource for researchers seeking advanced, programmable nucleases tailored for specific editing tasks.

## System Overview

The primary release, **OpenCRISPR-1**, represents a breakthrough in AI-driven protein design. It consists of a Cas9-like protein and a compatible guide RNA, both generated using large language models. Unlike natural Cas9 variants, OpenCRISPR-1 features hundreds of unique mutations while maintaining the prototypical architecture of a Type II nuclease.

**Key Features:**
*   **AI-Designed:** Generated entirely by Profluent's LLMs.
*   **High Compatibility:** Functions as a drop-in replacement for SpCas9 protocols with NGG PAM preference.
*   **Versatile Formats:** Can be adapted into deactivated or nickase formats for base, prime, or epigenome editing.
